 * To handle such scenarios, `Buffer` provides methods to read and write values in different formats.

 * Buffer.writeInt8(value, offset) - Writes a signed 8-bit integer at the specified offset.
 * Buffer.readInt8(offset) - Reads a signed 8-bit integer from the specified offset.
 * Buffer.writeUInt8(value, offset) - Writes an unsigned 8-bit integer at the specified offset.
 * Buffer.readUInt8(offset) - Reads an unsigned 8-bit integer from the specified offset.
