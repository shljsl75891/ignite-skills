# Namaste DSA

#### DSA = Data structures and Algorithms

> **Don't just study DSA for interviews** - Akshay Saini

- DSA is just like bodybuilding. It takes time and need patience.
- Just don't chase competitions, and take shortcuts.
- ❌Learn DSA, ✅ Understand DSA

### Thought process to approach any problem

1. Read the problem statement properly.
2. Think about possible approaches (dynamic programming, backtracking, two pointer, sliding etc.)
3. Think about the solution, and make it as optimal as possible on pen and paper or in mind.
4. Once solution seems optimized, analyze the time and space complexity.
5. Then only write the code in any language. Don't rush to code immedietly after reading problem statement.
