# Recursion

- When a function call itself to solve a smaller version of same problem, it is called Recursion.
- A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.

## Two Parts of Recursion

- **Base Case**: Stop condition (when to stop calling itself)
- **Recursive Case** part where function calls itself with a smaller input.

Base Case is essential to prevent infinite recursion and eventual stack overflow.
