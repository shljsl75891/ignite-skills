# Learnings

- Part of problem statements:
  - Increasing Order = `arr[i + 1] > arr[i]`
  - Decreasing Order = `arr[i + 1] < arr[i]`
  - Non Decreasing Order = `arr[i + 1] <= arr[i]`
  - Non Increasing Order = `arr[i + 1] >= arr[i]`
- In Place - without using extra space, means change the same array
- Only submit your solution after you dry run the code on found edge cases

## Patterns

- Two pointer approaches (both in reverse and normal order)
- Mathematics formulaes
- Bit manipulation
