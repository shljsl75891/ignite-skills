## Searching Algorithms

### Linear Search

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### Binary Search

- Time Complexity: O(log<sub>2</sub>n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

> It is only applicable on sorted arrays

## Sorting Algoritms

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

> Bubble sort is named 'bubble sort' because in this algorithm, during each iteration, the largest element bubbles up to the end of the array. As iterations progress, the largest elements continue bubbling up to their final positions at the end of the array, and smaller elements gradually bubbles up to beginning of the array.

### Selection Sort

### Insertion Sort

### Merge Sort
