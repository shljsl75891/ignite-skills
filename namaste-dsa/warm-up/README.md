#### Learnings

- Always think about corner cases such as:
  - What if array is empty
  - What if array has only one element
  - What if array has duplicate elements
  - What if array has only negative numbers
- This is a key skill to learn while understanding DSA and problem solving
- Always first build a working solution, and then think about any missing corner cases for 2-3 minutes
